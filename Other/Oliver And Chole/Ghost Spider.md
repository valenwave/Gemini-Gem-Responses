Here's a detailed prompt to replicate and customize the image of Ghost-Spider:

**Prompt:**

```
A full-body, stylized character portrait of Ghost-Spider (Gwen Stacy). She has short, bob-length blonde hair with dark roots, styled with a slight side part and some wisps framing her face. Her eyes are a striking light blue. She has a delicate, slightly upturned nose and full, lightly colored lips. Her expression is confident and slightly alluring, with a direct gaze.

She is wearing her iconic white and black Spider-Woman suit. The suit features a form-fitting, glossy black central body section, with sharp white angular designs that extend from her chest down to her thighs and also outline her torso. The white sections are particularly prominent on her sides and on the inner parts of her thighs. Her arms are covered by white sleeves that extend from her shoulders, transitioning into a vibrant purple web-patterned design on the outer part of her forearms and biceps. She also has a white hood with a purple inner lining that is pulled down, resting on her shoulders. The material of the suit appears to be a sleek, slightly reflective fabric, giving it a futuristic and almost latex-like quality in the black sections.

The pose is a dynamic, three-quarter profile shot, with her body angled slightly to the right. Her left arm is slightly bent, and her right arm is mostly out of frame. Her weight is shifted, emphasizing her curves. The lighting is soft and even, highlighting the contours of her body and the glossy texture of her suit. The background is a clean, minimalistic light gray to white gradient, with a subtle vignette effect, putting full focus on the character. The art style is a blend of digital painting and anime-inspired aesthetics, with crisp lines, smooth shading, and a high level of detail in the character's face and suit.



**Customization Ideas:**

* **Hair Color/Style:** Change to long red hair, braided dark brown hair, or short spiky black hair.
* **Eye Color:** Green, amber, or violet.
* **Suit Colors:** Replace the white and black with navy and silver, or red and gold. Change the purple web pattern to electric blue or neon green.
* **Suit Material:** Make the suit a matte fabric, a more textured armored look, or a glowing energy suit.
* **Pose/Action:** Have her in a mid-air pose with webs, a more aggressive fighting stance, or a relaxed, casual pose.
* **Expression:** Determined, playful, serious, or thoughtful.
* **Background:** New York City skyline at night, a futuristic cityscape, a comic book panel style background, or a cosmic nebula.
* **Lighting:** Dramatic chiaroscuro lighting, neon city glow, or natural sunlight.
* **Art Style:** More realistic, a cell-shaded comic book style, or a painterly, impressionistic look.
* **Accessories:** Add a backpack, a mask partially on, or a spider-drone.
