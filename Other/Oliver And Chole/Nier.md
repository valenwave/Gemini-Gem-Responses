Here's a detailed deconstruction of the image into a prompt, aiming for replicability and customization:

**Prompt:**

"A highly detailed, full-body portrait of a female character reminiscent of 2B from Nier: Automata. She has short, wavy, silver-white hair styled with a black headband, and striking blue eyes with a focused, determined expression. She wears a form-fitting, gothic-inspired black dress with long sleeves, a high collar, and intricate lacework or embroidery on the bodice, revealing a hint of cleavage. The dress features a high slit on the left side, showcasing her bare thigh, and is layered over what appears to be a golden or light-brown underskirt. She wears black sheer stockings and black opera-length gloves with a layered, ruffled cuff detail.

She is depicted in an action pose, holding a katana in both hands, positioned as if drawing or swinging it upwards. The katana's hilt is ornate with a golden and black tsuka-ito (handle wrapping) and a decorative tsuba (handguard). The blade itself is glowing with an intense, ethereal light, predominantly electric blue with subtle hints of purple and white, emanating energy streaks and arcs around it.

The background is dark and moody, filled with swirling, translucent ribbons or currents of light in shades of electric blue, purple, and magenta, creating a dynamic and magical atmosphere. The lighting is dramatic, with the primary light source coming from the glowing sword, casting highlights on her face, hair, and parts of her dress. The overall art style is digital painting with a high level of rendering detail, smooth transitions, and a slightly stylized, anime-influenced aesthetic. The composition is vertical, with the character occupying most of the frame."
