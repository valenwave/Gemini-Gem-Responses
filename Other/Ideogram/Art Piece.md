## Prompt 2

A digital art illustration of Sonic the Hedgehog and friends running through a misty forest at night. In the foreground, Sonic the Hedgehog leads the way in his signature blue form with white gloves and red shoes, followed by Tails the fox with orange fur and white markings, and Knuckles the Echidna in red with green accents. The forest path is illuminated by a full moon visible through the misty trees. A wooden signpost with a sign reading "EMERALD ZONE" stands on the left side of the path. The forest is filled with tall, twisted trees covered in green moss, creating a mysterious atmosphere. The lighting creates a dramatic contrast between the dark forest and the bright moonlight, casting shadows on the ground. The art style is modern 3D animation with smooth textures and vibrant colors. The image has a cinematic quality with depth of field and atmospheric effects.
