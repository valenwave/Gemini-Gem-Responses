BioShock Infinite, especially with its "Burial at Sea" DLC, truly delved into the multiverse concept and seemingly tied a neat bow on the entire "constants and variables" narrative, connecting Rapture and Columbia. The ending of *Infinite* itself, where Booker is drowned by multiple Elizabeths to prevent Comstock's existence across all realities, felt like a definitive conclusion to that specific story arc.

However, the "Burial at Sea" DLC complicated things by bringing a version of Elizabeth and a memory-wiped Booker (who is a Comstock from another reality) into Rapture. This DLC further solidified the idea that the "always a man, always a city, always a lighthouse" is a recurring theme across many universes, not necessarily just the Booker/Comstock one. Elizabeth's ultimate sacrifice in *Burial at Sea Episode Two* to ensure the events of the original *BioShock* could unfold (leading to Jack saving the Little Sisters) really felt like a final, poignant curtain call for her and Booker's intertwined fates.

**So, does BioShock have anywhere to go? Yes, absolutely, but probably not with the characters and direct plotlines of *Infinite* as their primary focus.** Here's why and what we might see:

* **The Multiverse is Always Open:** While the *Infinite* saga felt conclusive for Booker and Elizabeth, the very nature of the multiverse means there are infinite possibilities. A new game could explore a completely different "man, city, lighthouse" scenario with entirely new characters and settings. The core themes of ideological conflict, societal decay, and extraordinary powers could be reinterpreted in fresh ways.
* **A Return to Rapture (or a New City):** Rumors have been swirling for a while about a new BioShock game, often referred to as *BioShock 4* or by its codename "Parkside." There's been strong speculation, especially with recent reports, that this new game might involve a return to Rapture, perhaps a remake or "proper remaster" of the original. Even if it's a new entry, setting it in Rapture or another underwater/floating city would still fit the series' established aesthetic and philosophical underpinnings without directly continuing *Infinite*'s story.
* **New Developer, New Vision:** Ken Levine, the creative mind behind the original *BioShock* and *Infinite*, is working on a new game called *Judas* with his new studio, Ghost Story Games. While *Judas* shares some thematic and stylistic similarities with BioShock, it's a new IP and not a BioShock game. This means any future BioShock titles would be developed by a different team (Cloud Chamber Studios is confirmed to be working on *BioShock 4*). This new team would have the freedom to take the series in a fresh direction, unburdened by direct continuations of the previous protagonists' stories.
* **The Netflix Adaptation:** A live-action *BioShock* movie is in development at Netflix. This adaptation could either retell the original *BioShock* story or offer a new interpretation of the BioShock universe, potentially opening up new avenues for future game narratives, or simply existing as a separate entity.

**In summary:** While *BioShock Infinite* and its DLC provided a powerful and arguably definitive conclusion to *that specific narrative thread*, the broader *BioShock* universe and its core themes are ripe for further exploration. It's highly probable that a new game will emerge, but it's likely to introduce new characters and settings, perhaps revisiting the familiar depths of Rapture or venturing to an entirely new "city" altogether, rather than directly picking up after the events of *Infinite*. The constant is the allure of grand, fallen cities driven by extreme ideologies, and that's a well the series can draw from endlessly.
