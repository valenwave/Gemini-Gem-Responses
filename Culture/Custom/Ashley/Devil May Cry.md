The future of the *Devil May Cry* series is a topic of intense speculation and hope among its devoted fanbase, especially after the critically acclaimed *Devil May Cry 5*. While no *Devil May Cry 6* has been officially announced by Capcom, the ending of *DMC5* left plenty of threads for future installments.

**The "Sons of Sparda" Saga Concludes, A New Era Begins**

*Devil May Cry 5* delivered a triumphant conclusion to the long-running rivalry between Dante and Vergil. After their epic, fated battle, the brothers finally put their differences aside (somewhat) and, recognizing the continuous threat posed by the Qliphoth tree to the human world, decided to remain in the Underworld to sever its roots and prevent further demonic incursions. This left the human world's protection, and effectively the future of demon hunting, in the hands of **Nero**.

This "passing of the torch" is a significant development. Dante, while still iconic, appears to have embraced a more settled role with his brother in Hell, a playful yet eternal rivalry of demon-slaying. Vergil, after regaining his full power and seemingly finding a form of peace or acceptance, is also staying in the Underworld.

**Unfinished Plotlines and Future Possibilities:**

With Dante and Vergil essentially "on vacation" in Hell (albeit a very violent one), the stage is set for **Nero** to truly shine as the main protagonist.

* **Nero's Full Potential:** While Nero achieved his true Devil Trigger in *DMC5*, there's still room for him to grow. He's still relatively young and inexperienced compared to the Sparda twins. A future game could focus on him refining his powers, developing new Devil Breakers with Nico, and truly establishing himself as the premier demon hunter.
* **The Devil May Cry Business:** Nero is left to run the Devil May Cry office on Earth. This provides a natural hub for future missions, with Nico as his indispensable mechanic and partner.
* **Lady and Trish's Roles:** Lady and Trish, while active in *DMC5*, were somewhat sidelined. Their future involvement, perhaps taking on more prominent roles alongside Nero, or even exploring their own individual adventures, is a possibility.
* **Nero's Mother:** A major unanswered question, though not a critical cliffhanger, is the identity of Nero's mother. While it's not essential to the plot, it's a piece of lore fans would love to see explored.
* **The Throne of Hell and New Threats:** *DMC5* showed Urizen (Vergil's demon half) aiming for the throne of Hell. With both Dante and Vergil now in the Underworld, they are undoubtedly dealing with the power vacuum and potentially new, ambitious demon lords vying for control. This opens up opportunities for **Dante and Vergil to be playable in a secondary campaign or DLC**, showcasing their adventures in Hell and potentially facing older, more powerful demons like a fully revived **Mundus** (the main antagonist of *DMC1* and Sparda's nemesis), who was only sealed, not destroyed. Many fans speculate a return of Mundus, as it would bring the overarching narrative of the Sparda family full circle.
* **Sparda's Fate:** The ultimate fate of Sparda, the legendary demon knight and father of Dante and Vergil, remains a mystery. While bringing him back might undermine his legend, exploring his past or the impact of his actions could still be a compelling storyline, perhaps in a prequel or through unearthed lore.

**Capcom's Strategy and Rumors:**

Capcom has been on a roll with its major franchises like *Resident Evil* and *Monster Hunter*. While *Devil May Cry 5* was a success, it's generally not considered to be on the same tier in terms of sales as their biggest hitters. This often means a longer wait for sequels.

There have been persistent rumors and discussions online about *Devil May Cry 6*, with some even suggesting that it might put Dante and Vergil in the background initially, focusing heavily on Nero, and then reintroduce the legendary brothers in later content. However, **as of June 2025, there has been no official announcement or concrete details about *Devil May Cry 6* from Capcom.**

The release of a *Devil May Cry* anime on Netflix (released in 2024), which features Dante, Vergil, Lady, and Trish, shows that Capcom still has an interest in the franchise and is willing to explore it in other media. The success of such ventures could influence future game development.

**Overall Outlook:**

The *Devil May Cry* series is unlikely to end with *DMC5*. The ending clearly positions Nero as the central figure for future games, allowing for a fresh perspective while still leaving room for the beloved Sparda twins. While a *DMC6* might be some years away due to Capcom's development pipeline, the established lore, the intriguing new dynamic between the characters, and the continued popularity of the series almost guarantee its return. The question isn't *if*, but *when*, and what new stylish action Nero, and perhaps even Dante and Vergil from Hell, will bring.
