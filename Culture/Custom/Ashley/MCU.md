The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is currently in the midst of its "Multiverse Saga," encompassing Phases 4, 5, and 6. This saga began with *WandaVision* in 2021 and is set to culminate with two major *Avengers* films: *Avengers: Doomsday* in December 2026 and *Avengers: Secret Wars* in December 2027.

Here's a breakdown of what the future holds, based on confirmed projects, plotlines, and prevalent rumors:

**The Multiverse Saga's Trajectory (Phases 5 & 6)**

The Multiverse Saga is focused on exploring the vastness of the multiverse, its various inhabitants, and the threats that arise from interdimensional travel. The concept of Kang the Conqueror was initially set to be the primary antagonist, but recent developments suggest a shift.

**Key Upcoming Projects & Plotlines:**

* **Phase 5 (Concluding in July 2025):**
    * **Now playing (*as of June 2025*): *Thunderbolts***: This film features a team of anti-heroes and reformed villains (including Yelena Belova, Bucky Barnes, Red Guardian, U.S. Agent, Taskmaster, and Ghost) assembled by Valentina Allegra de Fontaine. It's expected to delve into their morally ambiguous missions and introduce The Sentry, who appears to be the antagonist as his Void persona.
    * ***Ironheart*** **(Disney+, June 24, 2025):** Riri Williams, introduced in *Black Panther: Wakanda Forever*, returns to Chicago in her advanced iron suit, facing new dangers.
    * ***The Fantastic Four: First Steps*** **(July 25, 2025):** This highly anticipated film introduces Marvel's First Family (Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards, Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm, Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Ben Grimm). It's set in an alternate 1960s New York City and is rumored to feature Galactus and Julia Garner's Silver Surfer. This movie is poised to kick off Phase 6.
    * ***Eyes of Wakanda*** **(Animated, Disney+, August 6, 2025):** An anthology series exploring different protectors of Wakanda throughout its history.
    * ***Marvel Zombies*** **(Animated, Disney+, October 2025):** Spinning off from a *What If...?* episode, this animated series reimagines the Marvel Universe with heroes battling a zombie scourge. Kamala Khan is said to be central to the miniseries, alongside characters like Kate Bishop, Yelena Belova, and Blade.
    * ***Wonder Man*** **(Disney+, December 2025):** Details are scarce, but this series is expected to introduce Simon Williams/Wonder Man, a character known for his acting career and ionic powers.
    * ***Daredevil: Born Again*** **(Disney+, Season 1 - 2025; Season 2 - confirmed for TBD):** Charlie Cox returns as Matt Murdock/Daredevil and Vincent D'Onofrio as Kingpin/Wilson Fisk. The series will explore the fallout of Season 1, including a major Daredevil character death and Fisk's ascension to mayor of New York City.
    * ***Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man*** **(Animated, Disney+, 2025):** An animated series following Peter Parker/Spider-Man.

* **Phase 6 (Leading to *Secret Wars*):**
    * ***Spider-Man: Brand New Day*** **(July 31, 2026):** Tom Holland returns as Peter Parker. Following the cliffhanger of *No Way Home*, this film is described as a "fresh start" for Spider-Man.
    * ***Avengers: Doomsday*** **(December 18, 2026):** Formerly titled *Avengers: The Kang Dynasty*, this film is now rumored to feature **Robert Downey Jr. returning as Doctor Doom**. This is a massive development that could redefine the entire saga's villainous threat. The film is expected to unite multiple MCU teams, possibly including Fox's X-Men.
    * ***Avengers: Secret Wars*** **(December 17, 2027):** This will be the culmination of the Multiverse Saga, adapting the beloved comic book storyline where various realities collide. Rumors suggest it could even be split into two parts due to its immense scope, and it's expected to feature a soft reboot of the MCU timeline, paving the way for the integration of the X-Men and Fantastic Four.

**Beyond the Multiverse Saga (Phase 7 and beyond):**

While details are scarce for anything post-*Secret Wars*, here's what's being heavily speculated:

* **The "Mutant Saga":** Many insiders and fans believe the next overarching saga after the Multiverse Saga will be centered around the **Mutants and the X-Men**. *Deadpool & Wolverine* (2024) already served as a major step in bringing Fox's X-Men characters into the MCU through the multiverse. *Secret Wars* is expected to solidify their presence in the prime MCU timeline.
    * An **X-Men Reboot** movie is confirmed to be in early development with a writer attached (Michael Lesslie) and a director reportedly eyed (Jake Schreier). It's expected to be a major film in Phase 7, potentially kicking off a new era for the MCU.
* **Fantastic Four's Continued Role:** With *The Fantastic Four: First Steps* launching Phase 6, their importance will only grow. A *Fantastic Four 2* is reportedly in development for 2028, suggesting they will be major players in the post-*Secret Wars* MCU.
* **Returning Heroes and New Threats:** We can expect sequels for established heroes (e.g., *Black Panther 3*, *Shang-Chi 2*, *Doctor Strange 3*, *Thor 5*) and the introduction of new characters (e.g., Nova, Vision in *Vision Quest*).
* **The Future of Blade:** *Blade*, starring Mahershala Ali, has faced numerous delays and its release date is currently TBD. It could potentially be part of the 2028 slate, or even lead into a *Midnight Sons* team-up.
* **Less Content, More Quality:** Kevin Feige and Disney have acknowledged that the increased content output post-*Endgame* may have led to a dip in quality for some projects. The strategy moving forward seems to be a reduction in the sheer volume of releases, focusing on higher quality and more impactful stories.

**Overall Outlook:**

The MCU is in a significant transitional period. The Multiverse Saga is building towards a monumental climax with *Avengers: Secret Wars*, which is widely expected to be a soft reboot, integrating the X-Men and Fantastic Four into the main continuity. The focus will likely shift to a new generation of heroes, with more emphasis on the long-awaited arrival of mutants. The future promises a fresh slate for the MCU, potentially with fewer, but more impactful, projects that redefine the shared universe for years to come.
