## Chapter 7: A Bad Time

The air in the Judgement Hall hung thick and heavy, not with the usual dust motes dancing in the golden light, but with an almost palpable tension. The stained-glass windows, once casting a vibrant, hopeful glow, now seemed to bleed sickly yellows and oranges across the cold, grey tiles. At the far end, silhouetted against the archway to the throne room, stood Sans. Not the usual grinning, pun-cracking skeleton, but a figure etched in a grim, unwavering resolve.

"hey there. you look like you're about to have a bad time."

His voice, usually a lighthearted drawl, was devoid of mirth, each word a stone dropping into a silent well. The jaunty tune that often accompanied his presence was replaced by a low, ominous hum, growing in intensity, a symphony of foreboding that promised only pain. This wasn't a casual encounter; this was a reckoning.

The battle box materialized, a stark, confined space, and immediately, the world exploded. There was no polite first move, no gentle opening gambit. Sans slammed me against the bottom of the box with an unseen force, bones erupting from the floor beneath my feet, forcing a desperate, instantaneous leap. The onslaught was relentless, a whirlwind of white and blue, of sharp edges and sudden shifts in gravity. My SOUL, a tiny red heart, flickered precariously, each hit stinging with a peculiar, dark energy that felt like a poison seeping into my very essence. *Karmic Retribution*, a silent whisper of the game's mechanics, explained the burning sensation. My sins, all of them, were catching up.

He moved with a fluidity that defied his skeletal frame, dodging my every feeble attempt to retaliate, a casual shrug accompanying each missed strike. His eye sockets, usually blank, would occasionally flash with an eerie, cerulean glow, a warning of the skeletal constructs he'd summon – Gaster Blasters. These monstrous, skull-like cannons materialized with a whirring hum, firing beams of raw energy that scorched the very air, forcing frantic, split-second dodges.

The environment itself became a weapon. Platforms appeared and vanished, forcing perilous jumps over chasms filled with upward-jutting bones. Gravity would suddenly invert, sending my SOUL hurtling towards the ceiling only to be pulled back down, a dizzying dance of survival. Sometimes, blue bones would appear, demanding stillness rather than movement, a cruel trick to punish the reflex-driven. He lectured, he quipped, he reminded me of every innocent life I had extinguished, each word a barb, dulling my senses with guilt even as I fought to preserve my rapidly dwindling HP.

"you're gonna have to try a little harder than that."

The phrase became a mantra, echoing in the suffocating silence of my failures. Each death was met with a sarcastic taunt, a reminder of the futility of my path. The save point, a beacon of hope in any other battle, was a mocking illusion here, simply returning me to the chilling threshold of the Judgement Hall, the same dialogue, the same relentless first attack.

Hours blurred into an agonizing cycle of attempts. My fingers cramped from the constant, precise movements required to navigate the labyrinthine bone patterns, to weave through the deadly Gaster Blaster formations. He would pause, occasionally, to offer a "mercy," a false reprieve that always ended in an inescapable trap, a bone wall springing up to impale my trusting SOUL. He reveled in the psychological torment as much as the physical, stripping away any lingering facade of control.

Just when exhaustion threatened to claim me, a subtle shift occurred. His movements, though still fluid, seemed to hold a fraction less energy. The wry smiles were replaced by a look of weary resignation. He began to monologue, a stream of consciousness about his brother, Papyrus, and the hope he once held for a future with monsters and humans living in harmony. It was a cruel irony, given the path I had chosen.

"look. i know you don't care about that. but... for my sake... could you at least try to understand?"

His "special attack" arrived, not with a flourish of power, but with a tired sigh. He simply… did nothing. The battle box remained, but no bones, no blasters, no gravity shifts. Just Sans, standing there, still, breathing heavily, clearly drained. He was stalling, waiting for me to lose patience, to make a mistake. The realization dawned on me: he was too tired to fight endlessly, but he could *dodge* endlessly. He was waiting for me to give up, to stop.

But I couldn't stop. Not now.

Minutes stretched into an eternity. He began to nod off, his eye sockets drooping, faint "ZZZs" appearing above his head. This was it. This was my chance. With a surge of adrenaline, I pushed my SOUL to the very edge of the battle box, then *slid* it. Inch by painstaking inch, it crept towards the "FIGHT" button. Sans stirred, his eyes snapping open for a split second, a flicker of surprise, then weariness. He was too slow.

The "FIGHT" button, a grim testament to my unwavering resolve, glowed. I slammed it, the impact reverberating through the hall.

My attack, finally, found its mark. The sickening crunch of bone was the only sound, a sharp contrast to the previous cacophony. Sans stumbled, a single crack appearing in his skull. His eyes, for a fleeting moment, widened in a mix of surprise and a strange, quiet understanding.

"welp. i'm going to grillby's."

He walked off-screen, a faint, almost inaudible sound of turning to dust filling the oppressive silence. And then, there was nothing. Only the lingering smell of ozone and a profound, chilling emptiness in the Judgement Hall. The golden light outside seemed colder, the victory hollow. The dust of countless monsters clung to my hands, and for the first time, the weight of it threatened to crush me.
