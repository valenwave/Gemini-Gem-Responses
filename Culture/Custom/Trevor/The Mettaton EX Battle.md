## Chapter 15: The Glitz and the Glamour of Destruction

The air in the CORE hummed with an electric anticipation, a stark contrast to the oppressive heat of Hotland. Neon lights flickered, casting long, distorted shadows across the metallic catwalks. This wasn't just a battle; it was a performance, and I, the unwitting star, was about to be thrust into the spotlight.

Then, from behind a shimmering, velvet curtain, he emerged. Mettaton, not in his blocky, box-like form, but transformed. He stood tall, slender, his metallic body gleaming under the stage lights, a single, fabulous wheel serving as his leg. His dark hair was meticulously styled, one eye adorned with a dazzling star, the other hidden behind a fringe. This was Mettaton EX, the ultimate entertainment robot, designed for combat and choreographed to perfection.

"OHHH YES!" His voice, a booming, synthesized baritone, filled the vast chamber, punctuated by a canned applause track. "WELCOME, DARLINGS, TO THE GRAND FINALE! THE CULMINATION OF YOUR JOURNEY! THE LAST STOP ON YOUR ROAD TO… FABULOUSNESS!"

The battle began not with a direct attack, but with a question. "DARLING, ARE YOU READY FOR YOUR CLOSE-UP?" Suddenly, the screen warped, and a "rating" meter appeared in the corner, fluctuating wildly with every action. This wasn't about HP, not entirely. This was about entertainment.

The first volley of attacks was a dizzying array of precision and showmanship. Disco balls descended, firing laser beams that followed me across the stage. Miniature Mettaton heads zipped around, spitting out tiny, heart-shaped projectiles. He danced, he posed, he struck a dramatic flourish before each new wave of danger. Each dodge, each narrow escape, felt like a move in a deadly ballet.

"DON'T YOU JUST LOVE THE DRAMA, DARLINGS?" he crooned, flipping his hair. Pink tiles appeared on the floor, exploding into a rain of tiny Mettatons, forcing a frantic scramble to safety. Then, a game show segment began. "TRIVIA TIME! WHAT'S THE CAPITAL OF WATERFALL?" The questions were absurd, the answers irrelevant, the real challenge was navigating the deadly objects he flung while waiting for the timer to run out.

He had an audience, too. A ghostly horde of fans, their faces illuminated by the glow of their phones, cheered and booed from the sidelines. The "ratings" meter became my focus. To win, I had to entertain. I had to pose dramatically after dodging a laser, compliment his hair, choose the most outlandish answers to his trivia questions. It felt ridiculous, but it worked. The ratings soared, the crowd roared, and Mettaton’s attacks grew more elaborate, his movements more extravagant.

He even threw in a cooking show segment, launching a series of miniature, exploding bombs disguised as ingredients, demanding that I "slice" them with my SOUL. It was chaos, it was brilliant, and it was utterly, uniquely Mettaton.

"OOOH, YOU'RE SO GOOD AT THIS, DARLING! ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT A NATURAL BORN STAR?"

His attacks grew faster, more intricate. Leg attacks, where his slender limb swept across the entire screen, forcing precise jumps. Heart bombs, which required me to guide smaller, heart-shaped bombs away from my SOUL before they detonated. Each phase of the fight was a new, deadly game, a fresh challenge to my reflexes and my ability to play along with his performance.

He talked constantly, a non-stop monologue about his dreams of stardom, his desire to escape the Underground and become a human celebrity. His motivation, once a shallow pursuit of fame, now felt tinged with a desperate longing for something more. This wasn't just a robot; this was a being with aspirations, albeit incredibly flashy ones.

The ratings continued to climb, the momentum of the battle building to a fever pitch. He began to sweat, a curious detail for a robot, his movements becoming slightly less precise, his voice cracking with exertion. The lights in the CORE intensified, strobing wildly, the music swelling to a triumphant crescendo.

"ALAS, DARLINGS! IT SEEMS EVEN I, THE FABULOUS METTATON, HAVE MY LIMITS!"

His final assault was a grand, desperate flourish. He spun, he twirled, he launched a barrage of every attack he had, all at once, a dazzling, terrifying ballet of destruction. The screen filled with lights, with hearts, with tiny Mettaton faces, forcing me to react purely on instinct, a blur of motion and near-misses.

And then, as suddenly as it began, it was over. His ratings reached their peak, the applause track reaching an ear-splitting volume. Mettaton EX, shimmering and exhausted, stood before me, chest heaving, a small crack appearing on his perfectly sculpted face.

"A-amazing, darling," he panted, his voice returning to a more natural, less dramatic tone. "You... you truly are a superstar. This has been... the greatest performance of my life."

He began to deflate, literally. His body seemed to lose its rigidity, his lights dimmed, and the star over his eye faded. He wasn't destroyed; he was simply… powered down, having given every ounce of his being to the show. The silence that followed was deafening, broken only by the faint hum of the CORE. The stage lights remained, casting a lonely glow on the now-still figure of the robot, a testament to a battle that was as much a spectacle as it was a fight for survival.
