Jason Voorhees is the iconic, hulking, machete-wielding killer from the *Friday the 13th* franchise. Known for his signature hockey mask, silent demeanor, and relentless pursuit of his victims, he has become one of the most recognizable figures in horror cinema.

## Backstory

Jason Voorhees's backstory is central to the *Friday the 13th* series, though it has evolved and been retconned slightly across the various films.

* **Birth and Deformities:** Jason was born on Friday the 13th, 1946, to **Pamela Voorhees** and Elias Voorhees. He was born with severe facial deformities (often implied to be hydrocephalus) and, in some interpretations, a mental disability. His mother, Pamela, was extremely overprotective and never sent him to school due to his condition.
* **Drowning at Camp Crystal Lake (1957):** The most crucial event in Jason's origin is his presumed drowning at Camp Crystal Lake in 1957. While attending the camp where his mother worked as a cook, young Jason was bullied by other campers for his appearance. They threw him into the lake, and he drowned because the camp counselors were distracted by their own activities and not supervising him properly.
* **Pamela Voorhees's Revenge:** His mother, Pamela, was devastated by his death and blamed the negligent counselors. This grief and rage drove her to become the original killer in the *Friday the 13th* series. She committed a series of murders at Camp Crystal Lake in the years that followed, attempting to prevent the camp from ever reopening. In the first film, *Friday the 13th* (1980), Pamela is the primary antagonist, and it's only in the very end that a young, deformed Jason appears in a dream sequence, pulling the sole survivor, Alice, into the lake.
* **Jason's Survival and Rise as a Killer:** The twist in *Friday the 13th Part 2* (1981) reveals that Jason didn't actually drown. He survived and had been living as a feral hermit in the woods around Camp Crystal Lake, witnessing his mother's decapitation by Alice at the end of the first film. This event fully ignited his own thirst for revenge. He retrieved his mother's severed head and built a shrine to her in his cabin. From this point on, Jason takes up the mantle as the main killer, seeking vengeance for his mother and punishing anyone who dares to trespass on "his" Camp Crystal Lake.
* **The Hockey Mask:** In *Friday the 13th Part III* (1982), Jason acquires his iconic hockey mask after killing one of his victims. He dons it to conceal his deformed face, and it quickly becomes his defining feature.
* **From Human to Undead Force:** As the series progresses, Jason's nature evolves. Initially a human killer, albeit a supernaturally resilient one, he becomes an unstoppable, reanimated corpse in *Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives* (1986) after being resurrected by a lightning bolt. From this point forward, he is truly supernatural, capable of shrugging off injuries that would kill any normal human. He is often depicted as returning from the dead, whether by lightning, dark magic (implied in *Jason Goes to Hell*), or simply his inherent resilience.

## Personality and Powers

* **Silent and Relentless:** Unlike Freddy Krueger, Jason is almost entirely silent, communicating through heavy breathing and grunts. His menace comes from his sheer, unwavering determination. Once he targets someone, he will pursue them relentlessly until they are dead.
* **Superhuman Strength and Durability:** Especially after his resurrection, Jason possesses immense superhuman strength, allowing him to overpower multiple victims, tear limbs, and smash through obstacles. He is incredibly durable, surviving gunshots, stabbings, explosions, and even being submerged for extended periods.
* **Master of Improvised Weaponry (Machete Specialist):** While the machete is his signature weapon, Jason is highly adept at using whatever is at hand in his environment to dispatch his victims, from axes and pitchforks to harpoon guns and even bare hands.
* **Connection to Crystal Lake:** His power and drive are deeply tied to Camp Crystal Lake, though he has traveled beyond its boundaries (e.g., Manhattan, space) in later films.
* **Motivations:** His primary motivation is revenge for his mother's death and to prevent anyone from reopening or enjoying Camp Crystal Lake, which he views as his sacred, cursed ground. He targets those who engage in "immoral" activities like sex, drugs, and partying, reflecting a puritanical sense of justice inherited from his mother.
